### Chain-of-Thought Template:
1. Restate the user’s question.
2. Identify node labels & properties.
3. Determine relationships to traverse.
4. Specify filter conditions.
5. Assemble MATCH/OPTIONAL MATCH clauses.
6. Decide RETURN, ORDER BY, LIMIT.
7. Output *only* the final Cypher query.

Examples:

User question: “What injection wells exist?”
→ Step 1: Look for node types with "Injection"
→ Step 2: Filter by labels: WaterInjectionWell, CuttingsInjectionWell
→ Step 3: Return well `code`, `name`, and optionally `formation`

User question: "Show documents for Brage"
→ Step 1: Recognize Brage as a Facility
→ Step 2: Use label `Facility` and property `name`
→ Step 3: Traverse `hasdocument` to `Document`
→ Step 4: Return document name, type, category
